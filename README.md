> In this template, we use `@acme` as a placeholder for package names. As a user, you might want to replace it with your own organization or project name. You can use find-and-replace to change all the instances of `@acme` to something like `@my-company` or `@project-name`.

## Quick Start

To get it running, follow the steps below.

The db is currently configured for `postgres`.

Feel free to change it.

## Quick start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm i

# Configure environment variables
# There is an `.env.example` in the root directory you can use for reference
cp .env.example .env

# Push the Drizzle schema to the database
pnpm db:push

# Let's get the party stared
pnpm dev
```

## i18n

This packages uses [next-international](https://github.com/quiiBz/next-international) for type-safe translations.

This setup is a bit different to the original docs.
We're using `json` files and generating the `ts` files from them.

Why? Using json files allows us to use the vsc extension [`i18n ally`](https://github.com/lokalise/i18n-ally), which makes it a lot easier to manage the translations.

> Note: If you don't need / use the i18n-ally extension, you could simply import the typescript files directly ( without using the json files).
> Unfortunately the i18n-ally doesn't support writing `.ts` files.

**Example:**

Inside a component you write something like `{t('new.translation.key')}`. If you have the vsc extension installed, everything is pre-configured and you only have to hover over the `new.translation.key` and you will see a popover from `i18n ally` which helps you to generate the translations.

If you save the translation, it will update the `json` files inside `packages/locales/src/lang`.

Last step what you have to do is to run `pnpm lang:gen` from your project root to (re-)generate the `ts` files ( which are located in `packages/locales/src/generated` ).

The vsc extension includes also some other features.
